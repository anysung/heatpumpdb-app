/**
 * Inquiry country-routing contract.
 *
 * Run: node tests/inquiry-routing.contract.mjs
 *
 * The Account page is ONE shared component across every edition, so a support
 * inquiry must carry the active country and reach that country's Admin context.
 * That path is client-side + Firestore, so it cannot be exercised end-to-end
 * without live credentials — but its contract is three small invariants in the
 * source, and a silent change to any of them would send inquiries to the wrong
 * (or one global) Admin destination. This test pins them.
 *
 * It also proves the layout task did NOT touch the routing files.
