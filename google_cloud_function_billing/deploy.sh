# Deploy: HeatPump DB account & billing function (accountBilling).
#
# Separate from google_cloud_function/ (news pipeline) — deploying this never
# touches the news function or its env vars.
#
# Env vars this script SETS (redeploying with plain `gcloud functions deploy`
# and no --set-env-vars preserves whatever is live):
#   PADDLE_WEBHOOK_SECRET  — from the Paddle dashboard (Notifications → Webhooks).
#                            Empty = webhook endpoint rejects everything (safe).
#   ALLOWED_ORIGINS        — extra browser origins (comma-separated), on top of
#                            the defaults baked into index.js. Part of the
#                            market-expansion checklist.
#
# Env vars this script now UPDATES rather than REPLACES, and only for values it
# was actually GIVEN. Two separate ways to lose a live credential were possible
# here: --set-env-vars wipes every variable it is not handed (so a deploy
# without PADDLE_API_KEY exported removed it), and --update-env-vars with an
# empty value overwrites the variable with an empty string, which for
# PADDLE_WEBHOOK_SECRET means the webhook endpoint starts rejecting every real
# Paddle notification. So an unset variable is now OMITTED from the update
# rather than sent as empty: to change one, export it; to keep it, don't.
#
# MEMBER EMAIL (support@heatpumpdb.eu, Zoho SMTP) — the mailbox password is a
# credential that can send as the company, so it lives in Secret Manager and is
# mounted, never passed on a command line or stored in an env var here.
# One-time setup:
#   1. Zoho Mail → support@heatpumpdb.eu → Security → App Passwords → create
#      one for "HeatPump DB function" (SMTP access must be enabled on the plan).
#   2. printf '%s' '<app-password>' | gcloud secrets create heatpumpdb-smtp-pass \
#        --data-file=- --project=$PROJECT_ID
#   3. Grant the function's runtime service account access:
#      gcloud secrets add-iam-policy-binding heatpumpdb-smtp-pass \
#        --member="serviceAccount:$(gcloud functions describe accountBilling \
#          --region=$REGION --project=$PROJECT_ID \
#          --format='value(serviceConfig.serviceAccountEmail)')" \
#        --role=roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor --project=$PROJECT_ID
#   TRIAL REMINDERS. /runTrialReminders is called by Cloud Scheduler once a day
#   and authenticates on an x-api-key header matching REMINDER_KEY, also mounted
#   from Secret Manager. The header is required ALWAYS — the x-cloudscheduler
#   header the news function trusts can be set by anyone, which is tolerable for
#   an idempotent rebuild and not for an endpoint that sends mail.
#     printf '%s' "$(openssl rand -hex 32)" | gcloud secrets create heatpumpdb-reminder-key \
#       --data-file=- --project=$PROJECT_ID
#   The scheduler job must carry the same value in its header; rotating means
#   updating both.
#
#   Rotating the password = add a new secret version; no redeploy needed.
#   Without the secret the endpoint returns 503 and records the failure — it
#   never silently drops a message.
#
#   WHICH ACCOUNT AUTHENTICATES is not always the address we send AS. In Zoho,
#   support@heatpumpdb.eu can be either its own user or an ALIAS on another
#   user (mail addressed to it then lands in that user's inbox). SMTP AUTH
#   always uses a real user; the alias may only appear in From. So:
#     SUPPORT_FROM  the address members see and reply to   (support@heatpumpdb.eu)
#     SMTP_USER     the mailbox that authenticates          (defaults to SUPPORT_FROM;
#                   set it to the owning user when the support address is an alias)
#   Export them before deploying if either differs from the default, e.g.
#     SMTP_USER=admin@deutsch180.com ./deploy.sh
#   Getting this wrong shows up as a 535 (auth) or 553 (From not permitted) in
#   the failure this function records — not as a silent drop.
#
# After the FIRST deploy also create the Firestore TTL policy that auto-deletes
# expired email-history entries (1 year after account deletion):
#   gcloud firestore fields ttls update retentionUntil \
#     --collection-group=emailRegistry --enable-ttl --project=$PROJECT_ID
#
# The client needs the function URL as VITE_BILLING_FN_URL at build time —
# until that is set, the app keeps the legacy pending/approval signup flow.
