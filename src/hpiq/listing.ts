/**
 * Local listing status — an OVERLAY on a canonical technical product.
 *
 * Every market publishes the same canonical products. The local registry answers
 * one question only: has this country listed this product? It never creates a
 * product, never supplies a spec, and never removes one when a match fails.
 * (docs/CANONICAL_TECHNICAL_BASELINE_AND_LOCAL_MARKET_OVERLAY.md)
 *
 *   DE → BAFA registry   the German catalogue IS the registry, so a product's
 *                        absence from the current snapshot is verified fact.
 *                        Germany is the only market that may say "no longer listed".
 *   GB → Ofgem PEL       an overlay. A confirmed match says "PEL Listed". Anything
 *                        else says "verification required" — a failed automated
 *                        match is a fact about OUR MATCHING, not about the PEL.
 *                        Absence of a match is not evidence of absence.
 *   FR → none            France has no national product list. Nothing is shown; a
 *                        foreign registry's listing is never relabelled as French.
 *   PL → Lista ZUM       an overlay, PEL rules: a confirmed match says
 *                        "ZUM listed" (na liście ZUM); anything else says
 *                        verification required. Never "not on ZUM".
 *   IT → GSE Conto Termico catalogue (III.A) — an overlay, PEL rules: a
 *                        confirmed match says "nel catalogo GSE"; anything
 *                        else says verification required. Never "not in the
 *                        catalogue". The catalogue publishes no per-row id,
 *                        so no identifier is ever shown — status only.
