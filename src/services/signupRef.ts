/**
 * signupRef — which marketing channel brought this signup.
 *
 * Solo-operator marketing runs on time, not money, and the only way to decide
 * where the time goes is to know which channel actually produces accounts.
 * Every outbound link we control carries `?ref=<channel>` (LinkedIn comments,
 * the news/guide CTAs, YouTube descriptions); this module catches the value on
 * arrival and the registration flow stamps it on the profile. The admin
 * Marketing page then counts signups per channel — automatically, which is the
 * difference between a dashboard and a chore.
 *
 * sessionStorage, not localStorage: attribution should describe THIS visit.
 * A ref that sticks for weeks would credit the first touch with a conversion
 * that a later channel earned, silently — worse than no data.

/** The channels we actually use. An open vocabulary invites typos that split
 *  one channel into five rows ("li", "LI", "linkedIn"…), so this stays a closed
 *  list and anything unrecognised is filed as 'other'.
 *
 *  Campaign variants must therefore be ADDED HERE BEFORE THE LINKS GO OUT.
 *  The Special Report links (2026-08) were built with per-market refs and would
 *  all have landed in 'other' — one indistinguishable pile — if this list had
 *  not been extended first. Anything new gets the same treatment: add it here,
