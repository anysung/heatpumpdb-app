 * ACCOUNT rather than from this request, and records every send. A browser can
 * name a member; it can never name an address.
 *
 * The address matters: support@heatpumpdb.eu is what the legal pages publish,
 * so it is where a member's reply has to arrive. Sending from anywhere else
 * would ask people to reply into a mailbox nobody reads.
