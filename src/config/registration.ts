/**
 * Registration availability — one shared flag for every country edition.
 *
 * New-user registration is PAUSED (Jul 2026) while the European expansion review
 * runs. DE, GB and FR are the same build with a different VITE_COUNTRY_CODE, so
 * this single flag covers all three; there is deliberately no per-country switch.
 *
 * SCOPE — this is a UI pause, and only that. While it is closed, the Sign Up
 * entry stays visible but opens a maintenance notice instead of the form, so a
 * normal user cannot complete registration through the app. It is not a security
 * control: Firebase Auth and the Firestore rules are untouched, so registration
 * remains technically possible for anyone calling the APIs directly.
 *
 * TO REOPEN: set REGISTRATION_OPEN = true here, rebuild, deploy. Nothing reopens
 * on its own — REOPEN_DATE below is display copy that no code compares against
 * the clock.
