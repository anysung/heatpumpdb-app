 * The four policy pages are reachable WITHOUT a login on the same customer-facing

 * before the auth gate). One shared set of routes for every country edition.
 *
 * IDENTITY: the full operator identity — trading name, owner, registered address,
 * business registration number and merchant of record — is published in the
 * LEGAL NOTICE (the `imprint` document) and, for the parts that belong there, in
 * the Terms operator provision and the Privacy "Data Controller" section. These
 * are the same verified facts in every country edition, from the constants below
 * (one source of truth). The marketing surfaces — homepage, pricing cards, nav,
 * Account summary — deliberately do NOT repeat the owner name, address, country
 * or registration number: those stay one click away in the Legal Notice.
 * The identity facts (trading name, owner, address, registration number, email)
 * are never translated; only the surrounding headings and sentences are.
