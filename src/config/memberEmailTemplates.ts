/**
 * memberEmailTemplates — starting points for a message to a member.
 *
 * A template is a DRAFT, never a send. Every one of these opens in an editable
 * composer because the facts differ per case and the admin is the one who
 * knows them.
 *
 * WHAT A SUSPENSION NOTICE SAYS, AND WHAT IT WITHHOLDS
 * It states that a review found an irregularity and that access is suspended
 * while that stands — and it does not itemise what was seen. That is deliberate
 * (owner decision, 2026-08-23): describing the signal teaches the next person
 * how to avoid it, and a reader with nothing to hide simply replies, which is
 * the outcome the appeal line is there to produce. What it must never do is
 * claim a specific finding we could not stand behind if asked, so the wording
 * stays at the level we can defend: a review, an irregularity, a decision.
 *
 * THE MULTI-EDITION PARAGRAPH IS NOT PART OF THE REASON
 * One account per national edition exists for the operational integrity of the
 * service, not to ration access, and a member who wants two editions is told
 * plainly to register each with its own address. It sits in the notice as
 * guidance, deliberately separate from the suspension: presenting it as the
 * cause would tell a reader who used two addresses that they were punished for
 * following the very rule we are quoting.
 *
 * The data-protection paragraph is a different matter and belongs in the
 * suspension notice: it restates the Data-use term the member already accepted
 * at registration, in the conditional. It never counts our defences or names
 * them — a reader who learns how many layers there are, or that published rows
 * carry markers of a particular kind, has learned how to work around them.
 *
 * English is the default because it is the one language every market's members
 * share. Translate in the composer when the member's market makes that kinder.

Nothing is charged unless you choose a plan yourself.
