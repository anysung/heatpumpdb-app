/**
 * subscriptionPlans.ts — the HeatPump DB subscription program (single source of truth).
 *
 * Program (decided 2026-07-12; trial model revised 2026-07-27; FREE + PREMIUM
 * repricing 2026-09-27 — docs/FREE_PREMIUM_PROGRAM_PLAN.md):
 *   Free tier by default; Premium = any of the plans below.
 *   Professional (1 user) / Team 3 (admin + 2) / Team 5 (admin + 4)
 *   Terms: monthly / annual (~17% off). The 6-month term is retired.
 *   Billing currency: EUR in every market (GB/PL included), VAT-exclusive.
 *
 *   FREE TRIAL = the IN-APP signup trial: 15 days of full access with NO
 *   payment method, granted server-side (finalizeSignup) at the account's
 *   first activation — ONE per email across the whole service, ever
 *   (emailRegistry). Paddle prices carry NO trial: checkout charges
 *   immediately. Team trials are ONE per organization, anchored to the team
 *   ADMIN's own signup trial — member join dates never extend it, and on day
 *   8 without payment the whole team is gated (accessUntilTs).
 *
 * Operating principles (enforced in UI + admin, not Paddle proration):
 *   - Plan and term are FIXED during a paid period. No mid-term upgrades,
 *     downgrades, seat changes or pro-rated charges.
 *   - Upgrades/downgrades are SCHEDULED and apply at the next renewal
 *     (subscriptionChangeRequests collection; ops/webhook applies them).
 *   - Team member replacement (remove + invite into the freed seat) is always
 *     allowed and never touches the Paddle subscription.
 *   - Downgrading Team 5 → Team 3 requires choosing the members to keep at
 *     scheduling time; the rest lose access at renewal.
 *   - Cancelling stops the next renewal only; access runs to period end.
 *
 * Prices are VAT-exclusive; Paddle computes VAT at checkout per country.
 * Paddle catalogue: 3 products × 3 recurring prices, NO trial on any price
 * (immediate charge — the free period lives in the app, not in Paddle).
 * The price ids live in paddlePrices.ts, keyed by currency (EUR today); a market
 * whose currency has no catalogue stays in "coming soon" mode.
