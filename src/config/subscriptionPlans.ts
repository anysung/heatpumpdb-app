/**
 * subscriptionPlans.ts — the HeatPump DB subscription program (single source of truth).
 *
 * Program (decided 2026-07-12):
 *   Professional (1 user) / Team 3 (admin + 2) / Team 5 (admin + 4)
 *   Terms: monthly / 6 months (~7% off) / annual (~17% off, "12 for the price of 10")
 *   Every new subscription starts with a 7-day free trial (payment method up front,
 *   first charge on day 8). Team trials are ONE per organization, anchored to the
 *   moment the team admin subscribed — member join dates never extend it.
 *
 * Operating principles (enforced in UI + admin, not Paddle proration):
 *   - Plan and term are FIXED during a paid period. No mid-term upgrades,
 *     downgrades, seat changes or pro-rated charges.
 *   - Upgrades/downgrades are SCHEDULED and apply at the next renewal
 *     (subscriptionChangeRequests collection; ops/webhook applies them).
 *   - Team member replacement (remove + invite into the freed seat) is always
 *     allowed and never touches the Paddle subscription.
 *   - Downgrading Team 5 → Team 3 requires choosing the members to keep at
 *     scheduling time; the rest lose access at renewal.
 *   - Cancelling stops the next renewal only; access runs to period end.
 *
 * Prices are VAT-exclusive; Paddle computes VAT at checkout per country.
 * Paddle catalogue: 3 products × 3 recurring prices, each with a 7-day trial.
 * The price ids live in paddlePrices.ts, keyed by currency (EUR today); a market
 * whose currency has no catalogue stays in "coming soon" mode.
