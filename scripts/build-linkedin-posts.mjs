/**
 * build-linkedin-posts.mjs — turn the published news archive into ready-to-post
 * LinkedIn packages for the company page "HeatPump Database Europe".
 *
 * WHY A PACKAGE AND NOT AN API CALL
 * Posting to a company Page needs LinkedIn's Community Management API, which is
 * a separate application review (weeks, and refusable), and its tokens expire
 * every 60 days — so "automatic" would still mean a human re-authenticating
 * several times a year. With a page at zero followers we do not yet know which
 * stories land, and automating an unread feed is the expensive way to learn
 * nothing. This produces everything the post needs; publishing stays a
 * 60-second copy/paste until the numbers say it is worth the API.
 *
 * WHAT EACH PACKAGE CONTAINS
 *   post.txt     the post body — hook, three lines, hashtags. NO link.
 *   comment.txt  the article link, to be pasted as the FIRST COMMENT.
 *   image.jpg    the article's image, converted from WebP (LinkedIn rejects WebP).
 *   meta.json    market, date, category, headline — for the queue and for later API use.
 *
 * The link lives in the comment because LinkedIn suppresses the reach of posts
 * that carry an outbound link in the body. The image is what earns the stop;
 * the comment is what earns the click.
 *
 * English only, on purpose: one page serving DE/FR/PL/IT/GB in four languages
 * would be unreadable to 80% of its own audience, and "five markets in one
 * place" is the actual pitch. Every article already has an English original
 * (the localized copies are translations of it), so nothing is re-translated.
 *
 * Run:  node scripts/build-linkedin-posts.mjs            # all markets
 *       node scripts/build-linkedin-posts.mjs PL         # one market
 *       node scripts/build-linkedin-posts.mjs ALL <dir>  # somewhere else
 * Out:  ~/Downloads/HeatPumpDB_LinkedIn_posts_<YYYY-MM>/  — never the repo.
 *       Regenerate any time; the snapshot in data_sources/news_public is the
 *       only thing that has to survive.
