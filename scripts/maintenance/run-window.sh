# Monthly maintenance window — launchd entry point.
#
# launchd starts with almost no environment: no nvm, no gcloud, no firebase, and
# no secrets. Everything the run needs is assembled here so the plist stays
# free of both PATHs and keys.
#
# The window is defined in Europe/Berlin; launchd only understands this Mac's
# local time. So the plist fires on several candidate hours and
# `--if-window` decides which firing is the real one — that is what keeps the
# schedule correct across European summer time.
