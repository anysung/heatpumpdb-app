/**
 * data-sheet-eligibility.mjs — the ONE rule deciding whether a canonical product
 * is fit to be a public product with a Data Sheet.
 *
 * Every country site publishes the same canonical technical products, so this
 * rule is shared: a product that cannot produce a useful Data Sheet in Germany
 * cannot produce one in the UK either.
 *
 * The rule is deliberately about the DATA SHEET, not about "having a record". A
 * sheet with a manufacturer, a model and a registration number is not a data
 * sheet — it is a business card. What makes the sheet worth generating is a
 * capacity the reader can size against, an energy class, and enough measured
 * performance to compare products.
 *
 * Thresholds were set from the actual field availability of the July 2026
 * canonical baseline (7,155 products) — never from what we wish existed:
 *
 *   manufacturer / model / canonical id / rated capacity / ηs(35°C) / type
 *                                                        → present on 100 %
 *   refrigerant 7,136 · sound power 6,961 · COP A7 6,225 · COP A2 6,150 · SCOP 4,488
 *   indoor sound power — the sound figure for indoor-sited (ground/exhaust) units
 *   dimensions & weight  3,321  (46 %)  → NOT required: too sparse to demand
 *   max water temp / operating range    → NOT in the schema at all
 *
 * So: everything universally present is REQUIRED, and of the five measured
 * performance fields a product must publish at least two (see MIN_CORE_FIELDS).
 * That keeps 7,063 products and rejects 92 whose performance section would be a
 * single lonely field.

/**
 * Rated capacity — the SAME chain the app segments on (src/config/segmentation.ts).

 * output whose measurement basis the source does not state (today: IT

 * It exists only on such records — every other market's products resolve on

                     the record must also carry its registry provenance and
                     its component identity where the catalogue publishes one)
     type + segment  supported family string + resolvable rated capacity
     performance     ηs and/or SCOP from the catalogue (gse_ratings), i.e.
                     the sheet always has capacity plus at least one seasonal
                     performance figure — never capacity alone
     provenance      gse_entry_key + catalogue identity (III.A)
